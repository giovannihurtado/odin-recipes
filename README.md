# Simple Recipe Page

---

Welcome to my humble recipe collection! For now, this is a basic web page built entirely with HTML, showcasing some of my favorite recipes. The idea is to keep it simple and accessible so anyone can easily find and read the recipes without fuss.

## 🚀 Features (for now)

- **Recipe Listing:** Each recipe is presented clearly with its ingredients and steps.
- **HTML Only:** No CSS or JavaScript, making it extremely lightweight and fast to load.
- **Content-Focused:** The priority is the recipe information itself.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The fundamental structure of the page is built using the latest HTML standard.

## 📖 How to View the Project

It's very straightforward. You only need a web browser:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if it's in a Git repository):
    ```bash
    git clone [git@github.com:giovannihurtado/odin-recipes.git]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd giovannihurtado/odin-recipes
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file** directly in your preferred browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or dragging it into the browser window.

## 📝 Next Steps (Future Ideas)

This is just the beginning! I have a few ideas to enhance this recipe page:

- **Styling with CSS:** Improve the appearance and readability.
- **Interactivity with JavaScript:** Perhaps add filters, search functionality, or serving size calculators.
- **Dynamic Recipes:** Make it easier to add, edit, or delete recipes.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the page looks good on mobile devices.

## 🤝 Contributions

For now, as this is a very basic project, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you have any suggestions or find a bug, feel free to open an _issue_!

I hope you enjoy exploring the recipes!
