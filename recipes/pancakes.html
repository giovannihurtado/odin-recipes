    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already
      have everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour
        <span>
          All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes
          structure and pleasant chewiness.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar<span
          >Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may
          create a tender texture.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking Powder<span
          >Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter,
          which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt<span
          >Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including
          pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but
          you'll miss it if you leave it out</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        An Egg<span
          >Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure.
          The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk<span
          >Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential
          for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive
          batter.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Vegetable Oil<span
          >Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to
          use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them
          from sticking to the pan.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Bananas<span
          >Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for
          these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients
          together and add mellow, fruity flavor.</span

    <h2>How to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>
    <p>
      It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe.
      You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you
      can expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix<span
          >Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in
          one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed
          bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the
          wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your
          batter is slightly lumpy.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook<span
          >Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle
          over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula,
          and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden
          brown).</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve<span
          >Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or
          with your favorite pancake toppings.</span
        >
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Fruit and Whipped Cream</h3>
    <p>
      Add a little color to your breakfast plate with fresh berries, citrus
      wedges, or even some banana slices to really drive the theme home.
      Homemade or store-bought whipped cream is an extra special touch that
      pairs perfectly with fruit.
