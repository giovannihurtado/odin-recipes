      This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way my
      grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in the
      juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.

      Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a
      detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe
      below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken
      recipe of your life:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird
        is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black
        pepper, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to
        adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor.
        Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Roast a Chicken Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      roasted chicken:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
      <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
      <li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
      <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Long to Roast a Chicken</h3>
    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a 3-pound whole chicken should be
      completely cooked in a little more than an hour. You'll know it's done
      when the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and an
      instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh
      (near the bone) reads 165 degrees F.
